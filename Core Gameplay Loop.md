# Core Mechanics

In Brink, your goal is to survive another day. In order to do this, you need funds. To get funds, you do work in the shadows. 



Each month, the crew will hear about potential job opportunities for a run. Typically there will be a timetable involved or another conflicting job option the crew will have to choose between. Once chosen, all jobs go through the same basic overarching structure:

1. **The Pitch:** Once the team chooses a job, they will have to meet with the client. This is usually done in person to avoid scrutiny on the grid, and is often very tense. There is a lot of negotiation done typically.
2. **Legwork:** If the job is accepted, the team can get started on the legwork. Legwork is all the detail work of gathering information and planning the job. Legwork plays an important role, because it allows the GM to not have to plan out how the job should play out, but rather, just the details surrounding the job -- the players' discovery of and response to those details leads to more interesting approaches and outcomes. 
3. **The Mission:** The execution of the actual mission forms the bulk of the gameplay, and includes the Insertion and Extraction. 
6. **The Payout:** The crew will have to meet in person again to get the payout from the client.
