# 1. Character Creation
Characters in BRINK are built by spending a pool of starting Experience Points to purchase Distinctions. Distinctions are unique details of the character's history attached to different elements on the character sheet. 
* 1. Build an Archetype
* 2. Select Priorities
* 3. Purchase Distinctions
* 4. Spend Resources
## 1. Build an Archetype
Each character starts with an archetype. To define your archetype, select a Background, a Role, and a Cause. 
* Your background is your old life before the brink. It decides your core attribute, your first two core capabilities, a few ranks of contacts, and some free assets to start with. 
* Your Role is the type of work you specialize in as a runner. It grants you two additional core capabilities, and additional starting funds. 
## 1. Select Priorities
Each character begins with 100 Experience Points (XP) at character creation, with which to purchase Distinctions. This pool of XP is divided into five smaller subsets called **Priorities**:
* Priority 1 ... 35 XP
* Priority 2 ... 25 XP
* Priority 3 ... 20 XP
* Priority 4 ... 12 XP
* Priority 5 ... 8 XP

Along the same lines, Distinctions are also divided into five groups. Select a priority to use for each of the following, based on how important they are to your character:

* **Body**: Your physical attributes, Health and Stamina.
* **Mind**: Your mental attributes, peace of mind, and mental well-being. 
* **Social**: Your social attributes, as well as Contacts made.
* **Skills**: Your various Capabilities and Specialties. 
* **Resources**: Your funds, assets, and lifestyle elements. 
* 

## 2. Purchase Distinctions

Once you've decided where to allocate your five Priorities, it's time to begin purchasing Distinctions to build out your character. 

### Negative Distinctions

Note that not all Distinctions are positive; you can take some which are bad for your character in order to "get back" some experience points to spend. Their costs are listed in negative amounts instead of positive. 

Note that these experience points are not part of the five priorities, so can be spent on any Distinction group, but this must be done after all of your starting XP is already spent. 



## Spending XP

* Capabilities ... 2XP per rank
* Attributes ... 5XP per rank
* Specialty ... 2XP each
* Contacts ... 1XP per rank in Connection or Loyalty
* Funds ... 1XP per $1500

### Positive Distinctions
* Average - easy to lose in a crowd, forgettable face. 
* Cool Headed - extra nerve
* 







## Positive Distinctions

### Who You Were - 0XP

*Your old life is gone, but the person you were and the years you put in are still a part of you.*

+ Add 1 to all Attribute modifiers except Psiotic. 
+ Add 1 to a single Attribute modifier.

### Attributes...

*Every attribute should have a distinction to add 1. Then there should be a distinction to add 1 to one of the paired attributes (physical/mental/social). Then maybe a very expensive distinction to add one more.*

### Capabilities...
*Similar to attributes.
