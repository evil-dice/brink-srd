# Dice Types

In BRINK, when an uncertain outcome needs to play out, dice are used. There are multiple dice types used in BRINK, most of which are represented by different colored 6-sided or 8-sided dice.

Generally, results of 5 or better are good -- they generate Effect, which is used to determine if you succeed at your actions. Since the dice in BRINK represent elements of the fiction in effect for an action, there are three types of dice in every dice pool:

* **Base dice are drawn from the capability used for an action.** They are the foundation of any dice pool, and are represented by 6-sided dice.  

* **When a capability has a modifier linked to it, some base dice are swapped out for Edge dice.** Edge dice are represented by 8-sided dice, which means they have a higher chance to roll a 5 or better. 

* **Limit dice are added to the pool when you use something limited in your action.** Limit dice work like base dice, but they typically require some kind of trade-off by depleting something you have in limited supply.
