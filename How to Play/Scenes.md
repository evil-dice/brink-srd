# Scenes
The game generally plays out in a series of individual scenes. There are several types of scenes which the GM can use for working out various encounters you work through over the course of a game, known as setpieces.

## Combat
When the time for talk is over and the bullets start to fly, a scene can turn into a combat scene. 
Combat scenes use the meta clock to track character's **Actions**. Each action moves a character up the clock by one section.

## Playing Out a Scene
### The Conversation
Most of the scenes take the form of a conversation, in which the players and GM discuss what their characters are doing and how they are interacting within each scene. You don't have to act as your character literally (though, if you'd like to, feel free!). Just broadly describing what your character does or says is enough. The GM will decide when things merit an action test.  
There doesn't need to be an order of how people act during scenes which use the Conversation. Simply speak up where it is relevant in the scene and try not to interrupt anybody else in their moment. 
### Initiative
For many scenes, the Conversation will suffice, but in some scenes the order of the actions you take (as well as their effects) are relevant. In those scenes, the GM can call for Initiative. Initiative is used when time needs to "zoom in" for scenarios where the activities are fast and furious, and would be too hard to keep track of otherwise (such as during combat scenes). BRINK uses a special initiative currency called cooldown -- you can read more about this on page ##.
