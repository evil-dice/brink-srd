# Missions
In the world of BRINK, your crew engages in missions for various would-be employers. Generally, this is ugly work -- illegal, dangerous stuff that they are willing to pay someone to do regardless of the risks or moral ambiguity. 
Missions are driven through phases, and they are generally structured the same way regardless of the mission itself. 
## The Pitch
The first part of any mission is the Pitch. The Pitch is a tense negotiation with an **Employer**, the purpose of which is to set the criteria of the mission. 
Employers want to remain anonymous and not be traced to the mission, so naturally do not want to share all the details of everything. The players will have to engage in some back-and-forth to determine information or resources beyond the bare minimum.
