# Action Tests
When a character takes action in the world with an uncertain outcome, the GM can call for an action test and determine how the results go. 

To perform an action test, you gather a pool of dice representing your character's effort and roll them all at once to generate Effect. 

Every action has a Difficulty that is gauged by the GM. Imagine this as a literal gauge — for each Effect generated, one segment fills in. Fill the gauge, and your action succeeds; exceed the gauge, and it will succeed with some additional effectiveness. Fail to fill the gauge, and you fail to an appropriate degree. 

## Building a Dice Pool
To build a dice pool, the process is pretty simple. First, you add base dice for what you set out to do, then swap some of them for edge dice based on any related modifiers. 

#### 1. Specify a Goal and Approach
* First, state to the GM what your intent is with the action you are taking. In doing so, the intent will likely align well with one of the Capabilities on the character sheet. 

#### 2. Add Base Dice
* For each rank you have in the Capability that most aligns with your intent, add base dice to the pool. 

#### 3. Apply Modifiers
* For each rank in any applicable modifiers, replace a base die with an edge die. 
* If there are no base dice to replace, add one instead. 
#### 3. Add Limit Dice
* If the intent included anything which contributes Limit dice, such as an Asset, they are added now. 

## Generating Effect
Roll all the dice at once. Any + results generate Effect (abbreviated with the symbol ). Compare your total  to the difficulty gauge set by the GM for the action test (see the Gauging Difficulty sidebar). If you fill the gauge, the action succeeds. Otherwise, the action fails — but the GM should take into account by how much or how little when narrating what happens next. 
If you happen to exceed the difficulty gauge, the action succeeds with added effectiveness based on the excess . Sometimes the GM decides this, but some rules specify unique effects with a  cost — whenever you exceed a difficulty gauge, you can decide to use the added  to trigger these effects.
