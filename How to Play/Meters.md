# Meters
When a situation is complex and needs tracking over time, the GM can use meters. To do so, the GM simply draws a rectangle and divides it into a number of segments (typically between 3 and 12). The larger a meter, the more intricate the conflict it represents. The size of the individual segments don't matter (though ideally, you may want them large enough to be visible from across the table). 
The outcomes of relevant individual actions fills or depletes meters. At the GM's discretion, î¦ˆ can come into play as well. 
Meters are meant to track progress. When labeling a meter, it should represent the obstacle or goal, not the methodology. This is because presenting the obstacle allows the players to be more creative, rather than forcing them to go a particular route. 
As an example, you could fill segments for a *Locked Office* meter for things like searching the room, picking someone's pocket, or befriending someone with an extra key. The same meter might see segments deplete for making a guard suspicious, or dropping the key someplace where it is hard to retrieve. If that meter was labeled *Find the Key* or *Sneak Into The Office*, the players would be forced to much more narrow actions. 
GMs are encouraged to use meters as mechanisms wherever appropriate. Below are some example cases when to use meters. 
## Heat
Various entities throughout the city are always monitoring the goings on happening on the brink. Meters are used to track just how much attention your crew has drawn onto itself with your actions. 
## Rising Threats
A bar can represent a progressively increasing threat.  When the scenario being played out increases the danger, fill in segments of the bar; when it is full, the danger comes to fruition. 
## Opposing Goals
Two opposing meters may be used to represent two opposite outcomes in a scenario. In such cases, the segments are filled in as appropriate and the first bar to fill is the ultimate result. This method of using meters works great for chases, struggles, and arguments!
## Time Limits
A bar can be used to track a window of time, with the GM filling in the segments periodically to indicate time ticking away. Once the bar is full, the window of opportunity closes. An excellent way to represent a mission or scene  with a time limit. A bar can also start full and deplete as time runs out.  
## Struggles
A bar can represent a struggle in a back-and-forth situation. Some events will fill the the bar segments, and others will empty them. If the bar is emptied, one side wins; if it is filled, the other side wins. 
## Linked
The GM may use meters that ultimately trigger other meters. For example, a bar called Surrounded may begin to start filling once another bar called Back Up has filled. 
## Long-Term Project
Sometimes a long term project is a bar with many segments that can be worked toward over time. It is often 
## Secrets
The GM does not have to reveal what a clock is for, or even show it to the players. Circumstances the player characters are unaware of represented on unlabeled meters can be an excellent tension building tool! 
## Social Scenarios
A progress meter can be used to represent many social scenarios effectively. It is highly effective as a way to track the facts known about a mystery, as well as the general attitude of a group.
