# Zones and Areas
BRINK does not use movement distances or speeds in combat scenes. Instead, an area where combat occurs is broken up into zones by the GM. 
A zone is an abstraction of a physical space in the game world. A zone has areas within it, which are small "islands" of distinct fiction-driven positions. If the zone is **The Bar**, then areas within it are more specific positions like *Behind the Bar* or *In Front of the Bar*, or even *Under the Bar*. 
The GM can quickly set up these zones and their areas when combat begins by using sticky notes. Simply label a sticky with a name for a particular zone, and then list the areas associated with it (ideally with some shapes to separate them). Arrange these to broadly approximate the different zones in relation to where they physically are -- a character should need to go from the **Lobby** to the **Hallway** to reach the **Stairwell** at the end of the hall, for example. 
## Zones and Movement
When a character performs a move action in combat, they can move to an adjacent zone, or to any area within the zone they currently occupy. Players and the GM can use dice (or even miniatures, if you are so inclined) to represent the relative positions of everyone. 
### Obstructed Movement
Sometimes movement will be hindered or impaired somehow, either by the environment or the circumstances of what is happening at the time. When this happens, a character has to use additional actions to get to where they need to go. 
### Fast Movement
Some characters have special capabilities that grant them additional speed. These sorts of abilities are handled by allowing the character to perform a Move as a free action. 
### Blocked Movement
If there is a reason a zone is inaccessible from a neighboring zone, the GM can draw X's along the side of the sticky note to indicate that you can't cross into it from that side. 
### Engagement Range
The space immediately around each character in a zone is itself an area you can move to. This is known as Engagement range. You move to Engagement Range the same way you move to any other area within a zone. Engagement range is required for up-close interactions like attacking with most melee weapons. 
### Large Spaces
If you are dealing with a very large space, you should use zones to separate that space, even if it is all one large area. This is to help ensure movement rules work in a large space, instead of letting characters spend one move action to move huge lengths of space in one go. You could make a zone called **Parking Lot** for example, and it could be adjacent to another zone called **Streets**. But it would be very strange if a character could run across the entire parking lot in just one move action. 
A good rule of thumb is to think of a football field. If you made the whole **Football Field** a zone, a character could move from the one end zone to the other as quickly and easily as they could walk across a hallway. Instead, separating the field into zones makes it a lot more realistic to how things play out in reality. The GM has the final say.
