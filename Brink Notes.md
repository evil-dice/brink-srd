# Negotiation Ideas

* When you negotiate, the employer has a set of bars set up representing their resources and interests.
  * Funds
  * Anonymity
  * Involvement
  * Trust
  * Confidence
  * Payout
* The meta actions of the PCs affect these bars.  

# Conflict/Encounter Details

As scenes play out, the player characters can become engaged in different types of Conflicts. Each conflict uses a Meta Clock 

* Combat
* Subterfuge
* Negotiation
* Investigation
* Personal

Each type of conflict has *Sides* and each side has *Goals* they work toward.

A conflict uses structured play for resolution. During conflicts, the fiction of the actions undertaken by the characters are applied to broad tropes associated with the type of conflict being faced, which have their own methods of resolution.

## Conflict Types
### Combat Actions
In combat, your actions broadly will fall into the following goals: 
#### Damage
Inflict damage on an opposing character.
#### Move

Move from one zone to an adjacent zone.
#### Ready
Take time to perform an additional step to another action (Ready can be used to reload weapons, take aim, switch weapons, etc.)
#### Disrupt
Delay, disrupt or distract another character, increasing their position on the meta clock. Knockdowns, blinding an enemy, distractions, etc.
#### Defend
Take efforts to protect yourself from the actions of another character (taking cover, deploying a shield, using a smoke grenade, etc.) 
#### Interact

### Subterfuge
In subterfuge scenes, the meta currency is *Suspicion.*

* Blend In
* Avoid
* Convince

### Negotiation
### Investigation
### Personal

# Meta Actions

In scenes where there is conflict, the actions taken by the characters fall under specific uses known as  meta actions. A meta action is an intentionally broad description of an action you might take in a given conflict, so that rules can be applied to it. 

Meta actions are defined by their goals. The idea here is to make what you choose to do fit into reusable, easy-to-apply rules that can apply to the things you choose to do.

## General Meta Actions

There are several basic meta actions that can be used in any scenario. 

* Ready: You ready something whenever you have to prepare, build effort, or take additional steps to do another action. 
* Move: You move something whenever you are changing its position to a different zone (see Zones, pg ##). This can mean the literal physical position of something, or something more figurative. 
* Sustain: You sustain something when you maintain or intensify an effect or ability that requires concentration or effort from a previous action. 
* Disrupt: You disrupt another character whenever you affect or obstruct their ability to take their own actions.
* Interact: You interact with something when you use something in the zone with you. 

## Combat Meta Actions

In combat, there are some additional specific meta actions available. 

* Attack: You attack when you attempt to inflict damage against a target.
* Defend: You defend whenever you attempt to reduce or avoid any incoming damage. 

## Subterfuge Meta Actions

When you are in a situation where you need to engage in espionage or stealth, these additional subterfuge meta actions are in effect:

- Act Natural: You act natural when you try to appear like you belong in a place you aren't expected to be in.   
- Blend In: You blend in when you try to avoid scrutiny or being noticed. 
- Keep Cool: You keep cool whenever responding to scrutiny or trying to keep your cover straight.
- Stealth: You engage in stealth whenever you hide, or avoid being seen or discovered.

## Negotiation Meta Actions

When engaged in a negotiation, these additional negotiation meta actions are in effect:

* Make an Offer: You make an offer whenever you say you will accomplish a particular task.
* Pressure: You use pressure when you threaten or warn someone to gain their compliance. 
* Leverage: You use leverage when you  use knowledge or details to force someone to concede a point. 
*  

 



























# Encounter Types

# Combat

In combat, everything you do will fit broadly into one of the *combat actions* described here. When a character takes a turn, they may take up to *three combat actions* by default, gaining any cooldown accordingly.

On your turn, you declare what you will use each of your intended actions for, and then resolve them one at a time in the order stated. You must declare how you will use all of your character’s available actions at the start of your turn; no waiting to see outcomes and changing tactics, the fight is moving too fast! 

Sometimes, an action may require a prerequisite action to be taken first in preparation — such as using the Ready action to load a grenade launcher, or to take aim through a sniper scope. Where relevant, this will be noted with the combat actions.

In some situations a character may take a bonus action. Bonus actions do not count as one of your three combat actions, and you may only use one at a time in a given round.  

## Combat Actions

### Move
A character may move to any area within their current zone, to an adjacent zone, or into engagement range at a cost of 1 cooldown. At the GM's discretion you may need to use additional Move actions or incur additional cooldown to avoid hazards or obstacles, or clear large distances.  
### Attack
Use an appropriate capability to attack a target within range of a single weapon that is drawn and ready.

Melee weapons require you to be within engaged with an enemy, while most ranged weapons can fire at targets in the same or neighboring zones. Attack actions must be preceded by a Ready action When attacking outside a weapon's optimal range.

When you successfully perform an Attack action, the target takes damage equal to the weapon's base damage, plus any additional effect.  

### React
If you are targeted for a combat action while active, you may perform one combat action in response immediately, incurring cooldown as standard.  
### Wait
Gain any number of cooldown, voluntarily. This allows you to better coordinate with your allies to do things at the same time.  
### Ready

Select a weapon, item, or ability to ready it, performing an action test if required. Many aspects of the game require being readied to use (for example, drawing or reloading a weapon, casting a spell, pumping a shotgun, aiming a sniper rifle, etc.).  
### Interact
Interact with or utilize an object in the environment within range (i.e., open a door, break a window, use an item, etc.). Also used for Grid and Psiotic interactions, as well as benefitting from cover.  
### Concentrate
Maintain or intensify an effect or ability that requires concentration or effort from a previous action.  
### Focus
Suffer 1 box of Strain damage to upgrade all dice for one subsequent action during your turn.  
### Disrupt
Perform an action to disrupt or otherwise hinder another character, adding cooldown to them.  
### Command
Forgo the current action for an allied NPC

The Combat Clock

In LITE, the combat is driven by a simple system of tracking “time.” Note that this isn’t real time, or even in any particular increment, but rather, it is a measure of the time spent by your character performing actions during combat. The way this works is fairly simple: Every action that you undertake during a combat “spends” some of your “time.” This adds a delay on when your character may act again.

 
Using The Combat Clock  
Combat proceeds according to a game clock which starts at 1 and ends at 10, signifying which round of combat is currently being resolved. For easy tracking, this game clock is displayed along the side of your character sheet, along with a “personal” clock. Depending what you chose to do, you will have to wait X amount of rounds (or ticks of the clock) to perform another action — which is tracked by way of your personal clock.  
Each round, once all characters who may act at that point on the game clock may do so. Depending upon the action you choose to perform, you will then advance your personal clock upward. The game clock advances up a single notch once all characters in the combat at that round have acted. You may not act again until your personal clock coincides again with the game clock.  
Actions in a particular round are resolved in any order, and are considered to all occur close to simultaneously (the order of occurences within a round can be changed by GM decision, of course). Though it should go without saying, on the first round of a combat, all participants generally get to take an action.  
Obviously, there will sometimes be rounds where no one acts, for various reasons. When this happens, simply continue up the clock until a round is reached when someone can act. When you complete the final round, simply loop back to the bottom of the the appropriate clock and continue.  
Actions in Combat  
You may both move up to your Agility in spaces, and attempt a single action for each round of combat on the clock. These can be any type of actions you can attempt normally. Unless otherwise stated, most actions will advance a character’s personal clock by 2 ticks; links in a chained action will advance it by 1 extra tick per. Any actions may be attempted as normal, but note that only characters on the same tick of the combat clock may act in unison with one another.  
Attack Actions in Combat  
All attacks in LITE RPG are resolved as actions. Most of them will be opposed, as targets attempt to react to the attacks made against them.  
Weapons will list what stats and modifiers are used to attack with each weapon. The target may oppose the attack offensively or defensively. Defensive targets counter the roll with their stats (resisting the pain with your endurance), while offensive targets may counter the attack roll with attack rolls of their own (i.e. two melee fighters duelling). Targets caught by surprise may not counter the attack in any way.  
Roll the opposed action as is appropriate and tally the attacker and defender’s successes. If the attacker beats the defender, the defender takes damage as his counter fails. If the defender beats the attacker, however, he avoids damage, as the attack fails to cause any effect.  
Damage Allocation  
Each attacker success inflicts one point of damage to the target. Note that most weapons have a Damage bonus attributed to them, meaning that once you hit the enemy, these points of damage may be added to the damage inflicted on the target in addition to your those from your successful dice rolls. Standard enemies only have one “life bar,” but player characters can be hit in many locations, and so have several smaller ones.  
Once an player is hit, roll a D6 to see where the hit has struck, relative to the diagram on the character sheet. Once you have matched up the section, add the relevant damage inflicted to that particular body by writing in the number.  
Characters have light, major, and critical damage thresholds on all of their body sections. A damaged character may act as normal until a body section passes one of these thresholds. Then, penalties begin as the injury becomes too severe to ignore or fight through.  
Light wounds cause a -1 dice penalty to actions using that body part.  
Major wounds additionally cause unfavorable situations.  
Critical wounds render a limb useless, and may render you unconscious.  
Armor  
While armor in LITE can be anything from a suit of armor to a futuristic energy shield, it all has the basic mechanic. Whenever damage would be dealt to the player, deal the damage to the armor covering the targeted body part of the player first. Once no more damage can be absorbed by the armor, deal further damage to the player. While a shield might recharge itself, something more practical (like a medieval breastplate) will retain its damage between battles. Repairing or acquiring new armor will be a useful thing to do if you are expecting a tough fight!  
Falling Unconscious  
Anytime you take a critical wound, your character must roll his Endurance pool in order to maintain consciousness. Further damage to the critically wounded area will force this test again.  
If you fail the test your character will fall unconscious. But you will not sit idly. Unconscious characters enter into a struggle action, using their own Endurance value as both sides of the action. If the character can win the struggle against his own Endurance value, he will awaken and be able to continue fighting; otherwise, he remains unconscious.

Combat Example  
Martin and Rob are police, armed with standard handguns and batons. They encounter a terrorist armed with an AK-47.  
Combat begins at round 1. All characters begin at round 1 on their personal clocks, so all of them may act. Martin moves his character forward and uses his action to try to shout at the terrorist to get on the ground and drop his weapon. Martin uses his Persona stat in an opposed action agains the terrorist’s Persona, but the terrorist beats Martin’s roll and ignores his command. Martin then advances his combat clock two steps for attempting an action. The terrorist does not have to advance his own clock for defending because this was an opposed action, and not an actual attack.  
Rob decides to fire at the terrorist using a basic attack with his handgun. The handgun uses Perception +1 for handling, so Rob rolls his Perception pool of 4 dice, +1 extra due to the weapon’s handling bonus. The terrorist is active on this step of the combat clock, and decides to defend himself by ducking, since there is no penalty for doing so when you are on the same step of the clock as your attacker. Using his Agility stat against Rob’s attack, the terrorist manages to roll 2 successes against Rob’s 1, and so successfully avoids the attack. Rob advances his clock two steps, as the handgun’s stats specify; the terrorist does not advance his because he is active this round and his defense against the attack does not count against him.  
Now the terrorist acts. He fires his AK-47 at Rob. Because it has a strong kick-back, the handling of the weapon is listed as Strength -1, so the terrorist takes his basic strength pool of 5 and subtracts 1 die from it, rolling 4 dice. Rob ducks, using his agility pool of dice, but the terrorist hits him as he fails all of his rolls while the terrorist passes 1. The terrorist rolls a D6 and gets a 4, hitting rob in the right arm. The AK-47 has a large damage bonus of +5, so Rob takes 6 damage (1 from the terrorist’s successful attack roll, and 5 from the weapon’s damage bonus). Rob suffers a light wound in his arm. The terrorist’s clock advances 3 rounds, per the AK-47’s stats.  
The combat clock advances to round 2. No combatants are active, so it automatically advances to round 3, where Rob and Martin will be active. The terrorist is still a round away from acting again; his weapon has much more kick, and firing it is more time-consuming!  
Rob goes first, firing his weapon as before. But because his shooting arm has a light wound, he receives an addition -1 penalty to his dice pool. The terrorist does not bother to dodge; Rob’s attack is likely to not do much damage with only 4 dice, and dodging again would advance his clock and further delay his retaliation. Rob ends up missing completely, but must advance his clock two rounds again for his firing attempt.  
Martin now fires, and has the same stats and weapon as Rob does. The terrorist again does not dodge, in order to avoid further delaying his own return attacks. Martin rolls the attack unopposed and scores 3 successes. The terrorist must now take 6 damage, as the pistol’s damage bonus is +3. With enemies, the damage location is not rolled for, and so the hits are applied to the terrorist at central mass, striking his chest. 6 damage is enough to pass the terrorist’s light and major wound thresholds (3 and 3, respectively). The terrorist’s gamble has not paid off and now he will suffer an unfavorable situation for all actions as he rasps for breath. Martin advances his clock 2 rounds.  
With no more active combatants, the combat clock proceeds to round 4, where the terrorist is the only active combatant. The terrorist attempts to attack again, but due to the unfavorable situation penalty incurred by his wounds, he may only gain successes on a roll of 6+, and thus fails his attack. He advances his clock another 3 rounds.  
The clock advances to round 5, Rob and Martin are able to attack again. Rob makes an attack and scores 2 successes. The terrorist tries to dodge again, advancing his clock by a further 1 round, but his unfavorable situation due to his wounds makes certain he is not quick enough to succeed. Rob’s attack is successful, and inflicts 5 damage — enough to pass the terrorist’s critical wound threshold. Since basic enemies are said to always be hit in central mass, this wound would apply to the terrorist’s chest — meaning that he is dead.
